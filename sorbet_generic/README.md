# Sorbet Generic

This sample shows a proof of concept on how to use advanced Sorbet generics for activities, workflows, signals, queries,
and updates. The Temporal Ruby SDK does not have Sorbet signatures natively, so this is just a proof of concept on how
Sorbet users could consume the library if they have advanced needs.

⚠️ Users that are not concerned with advanced generic use cases can just use traditional `tapioca` generation to
generate the RBI files for Temporal Ruby SDK. This sample is only here to demonstrate **advanced generic use cases**.

See the "Issues" section for details on issues encountered during development.

To run, first see [README.md](../README.md) for prerequisites. Then, in this directory:

    bundle install

To check types, run:

    bundle exec srb tc

Note how you can change a parameter type when calling activity, workflow, signal, query, or update and type checking
will fail if it doesn't match expectation.

To actually run the code, from a terminal, start the worker:

    bundle exec ruby worker.rb

Then, from another terminal, run the workflow:

    bundle exec ruby starter.rb

## Issues

There are a few issues with Sorbet and advanced use that had to be worked around. See each section below.

### Generated Code Parameter Arity

The Temporal Ruby SDK does not use Sorbet itself and does  not take a `sorbet-runtime` dependency or have inline
signatures. Therefore, Temporal must be treated like any other non-Sorbet Ruby library. To generate the signatures
herein, we:

* Ran `bundle exec tapioca init`
* Ran `bundle exec tapioca require`
* Added `require 'google/protobuf'` to `tapioca/require.rb`
* Ran `bundle exec tapioca gem temporalio google-protobuf`

Unfortunately, due to the fact that the SDK supports splatted positional parameters (e.g. for a workflow) where a user
may want a well-typed limited set of parameters, we have to alter the generated code. As documented at
https://srb.help/4010:

> In cases like these, usually the solution is to remove the `foo` definition from `autogenerated/some_gem.rbi`

This means we had to hand-mutate the `tapioca`-generated RBI files, specifically we had to comment out all methods we
wanted to refine parameter arity on. Look for "NOTE: Manually removed" comments in
[sorbet/rbi/gems/temporalio@0.3.0.rbi](sorbet/rbi/gems/temporalio@0.3.0.rbi).

### Arity Mismatch

For generic reasons we had to define the base classes for workflows and activities as having a single input (which
Temporal encourages anyways). However, it is also normal to have _no_ input, but Sorbet disallows overrides to change
the parameter count, so a `_` placeholder param with a default has to be used to ignore it.

### Use of Decorator-Like Approach

When a signal, query, or update is defined on a method, the Ruby SDK also makes an associated class method for the
"definition" of that handler for use by clients. So when this is present:

```ruby
workflow_signal
sig { params(some_value: String).void }
def my_signal(some_value)
  @some_value = some_value
end
```

That creates a `my_signal` _class_ method on the workflow class dynamically. However, due to an
[issue in Sorbet](https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet/issues/8592) defining singleton methods in instance
`on_method_added`, this needs to change to:

```ruby
workflow_signal
T::Sig::WithoutRuntime.sig { params(some_value: String).void }
def my_signal(some_value)
  @some_value = some_value
end
```

This disables runtime behavior to prevent the bug.

### Referencing Generic Classes

In Sorbet a generic class is referenced using brackets. For example, to define a class method stub on a workflow to
represent the above-section-mentioned class methods created, one might have:

```ruby
sig { returns(Temporalio::Workflow::Definition::Signal[String]) }
def self.my_signal = T.unsafe(nil)
```

But this will fail at runtime because the Temporal Ruby SDK doesn't define `[]`. So you have to change this to:

```ruby
T::Sig::WithoutRuntime.sig { returns(Temporalio::Workflow::Definition::Signal[String]) }
def self.my_signal = T.unsafe(nil)
```

This will avoid processing the invalid body.
